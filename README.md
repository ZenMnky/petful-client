_just a quick practice project_
## Project Brief: 
You've been asked to create a site for an animal shelter which allows adoption of cats and dogs. These are the only 2 animals allowed in the shelter. The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first. In addition, people who want to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when it's their turn.
